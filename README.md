# Bridge_the_GAP
This work presents a bridge mechanism to improve the interaction between retrievers and Large Language Models (LLMs) in Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG). By combining supervised and reinforcement learning, we train a model that optimizes the retrieval-LLM connection, boosting performance in question-answering and generation tasks.
