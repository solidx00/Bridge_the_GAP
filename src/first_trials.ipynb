The tree-covered island is one of about 360 small islands in Mahone Bay and rises to a maximum of above sea level.

The island is best known for various theories about possible buried treasure\\nDocument [869567](Title: Oak Island) on the island. Oak Island Tours now owns 78% of the island. The remaining 22% of the island is owned by private parties. There are two permanent homes and two cottages occupied part-time on the island. The nearest community is the rural community of Western Shore which faces the island, while the nearest village is Chester . There have been documented treasure hunts, investigations and excavations on Oak Island since the 1850s. There are many theories about what, if anything, might be buried or concealed there. Areas of interest on the island with regard to treasure hunters include a location\\nDocument [869568](Title: Oak Island) known as the Money Pit, a formation of boulders called Nolan\\'s Cross, the beach at Smith\\'s Cove, and a triangle-shaped swamp. The Money Pit area has been repeatedly excavated; critics argue that there is no treasure and that the Money Pit is a natural phenomenon. More than fifty books have been published recounting the island\\'s history and exploring competing theories. Several works of fiction have been based upon the Money Pit, including \"The Money Pit Mystery\", \"Riptide\", \"The Hand of Robin Squires\", and \"Betrayed: The Legend of Oak Island\".

The hop plant\\'s reproduction method is that male and female flowers develop on separate plants, although occasionally a fertile individual will develop which contains both male and female flowers.

Philosopher George Berkeley, in his work, \"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\" (1710), proposes, \"But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them.

Nevertheless, Berkeley never actually wrote about the question. Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not.

The definition of sound, simplified, is a hearable noise. The tree will make a sound, even if nobody heard it, because it could have been heard.

A triangulation is a planar straight line graph to which no more edges may be added, so called because every face is necessarily a triangle; a special case of this is the Delaunay triangulation, a graph defined from a set of points in the plane by connecting two points with an edge whenever there exists a circle containing only those two points.

Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly, is an anti-slavery novel by American author Harriet Beecher Stowe. Published in 1852, the novel had a profound effect on attitudes toward African Americans and slavery in the U.S. and is said to have \"helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War\".

In the decade between the publication of \"Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin\" and the start of the American Civil War, between twenty and thirty anti-Tom books were published. Among these novels are two books titled \"Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin As It Is\" (one by W. L. Smith and the other by C. H. Wiley) and a book by John Pendleton Kennedy.

In the first year after it was published, 300,000 copies of the book were sold in the United States; one million copies in Great Britain.

It is a letter from Paul the Apostle to a number of Early Christian communities in Galatia. Scholars have suggested that this is either the Roman province of Galatia in southern Anatolia, or a large region defined by an ethnic group of Celtic people in central Anatolia. Paul is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law during the Apostolic Age. Paul argues that the Gentile Galatians do not need to adhere to the tenets\\nDocument [126990](Title: Epistle to the Galatians) late 50s, only a few years after the Antiochene incident he narrates\". Eminent Biblical scholar Helmut Koester also subscribes to the \"North Galatian Hypothesis\". Koester points out that the cities of Galatia in the north consist of Ankyra, Pessinus, and Gordium (of the Gordian Knot fame of Alexander the Great). The South Galatian view holds that Paul wrote Galatians before or shortly after the First Jerusalem Council, probably on his way to it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is\\nDocument [126991](Title: Epistle to the Galatians) in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian, or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49. A third theory is that Galatians 2:1–10 describes Paul and Barnabas\\' visit to Jerusalem described in Acts 11:30 and 12:25. This theory holds that the epistle was written before the Council was convened, possibly making it the earliest of Paul\\'s epistles. According to this theory, the revelation mentioned (Gal 2:2) corresponds with the prophecy of Agabus (Acts 11:27–28).
